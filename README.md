# Benchmark_TMD_GROUP_SIZE

Contains the results of the group size benchmark on a 2D MoS2 slab. For the parameters of the calculation, one can take a look at the GW.inp files in each directory, but note that they are not sufficient to get accurate physical results as the purpose here is only to get scaling informations wrt the group size.
